Supports OTG as well.Cons1. Camera below average still expected but samsung should work more on this front if they wanna beat chinese phones.2.Not for gamers and thats expected buy a 4gb Ram ü§î based phone why reading me?üòâ3.finger print and face lock missing I Can manage but most indians can't.4.Battery takes 3.15 hours to charge to work for 12 hours of calling and surfing and thats not bad at all but can be issue for chinese phone lovers who have habit of charging again and again to play pubg.Overall out of 5.Camera-2  Gui-4  Screen ppi-5  speed-4  android-4Don't buy a phone only because of specifications must see integration and longevity overall a nice secondary option and primary for featured phone switchers.\n\nRead more""]",['\n#samsunghitsbullseye\n'],['3.1 out of 5 stars'],"['\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy M01 Core (Black, 1GB RAM, 16GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n']"
B07DJCJBB3,"[""\n\n  Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.\n\nRead more""]",['\nHONEST M31s.

B07DJCJBBN,"[""\n\n  Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.\n\nRead more""]",['\nHONEST M31s.

B08BV2T63X,"[""\n\n  Okk I am writing a review after using one day ..I gifted this mobile to my mother and she liked a lot ..First of all I let you know this is an updated version of Eluga I7..as you can check on the pictures posted by me ..it's Eluga I7 Enterprise Edition..And this is updated to Android 9.0 pie..Whereas the Normal Version is only Android 7 version( which is available on Flipkart).This mobile does not have tray SIM slot..rather you can open the back cover and easily insert both the SIM and Memory card..and  has Non Hybrid Sim Slots..But point to note here is SIM 1 is Micro and SIM 2 Nano ..Camera quality is gud not so gorgeous with 8MP for both Front and Back ..with Flash Led lights on both sides..you can't expect more in this price range .The best thing is it's Battery Back up of 4000 MAH..Videos run smooth you tube and all.You can increase the Storage space .. accordingly.Doesn't support quick charging so it takes time for charging but the battery backup is worth .My Verdict would be if you are getting so many features fr a price of 6499 ..it's worth buying ..A thumbs up from me.üëçüëçüëç\n\nRead more""]",['\nUpdated version of Android 9..Eluga I7 Enterprise Edition\n'],['2.8 out of 5 stars'],"['\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPanasonic Eluga i7 (2GB RAM, 16GB Storage, Finger Print Sensor, 4000mAh Battery) (Black)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n']"

B08695ZSP6,"[""\n\n  Pros:1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS, which runs as smooth as they come.2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average.3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage.4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud. (Drawback in Cons)5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.6) Gaming performance is average. (Similar phones in this range have better gaming performances)7) The phone looks and feels premium while using.8) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes.9) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast)Cons:1) The camera is not as good as it was expected. The macro lens is pretty useless, and the main camera lacks depth and the colors aren't as vibrant as OnePlus 8. A bit too much of beautification was there in selfie shots. 4K video recording @ 60fps is absent but 1080@60fps performance is quite good. (The camera is better than most phones out there but it isn't what we were promised)2) No headphone jack.3) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio isn't as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker.4) No expandable memory slot.5) The plastic frame (doesn't look like plastic but it is) is a worrying thing and makes the phone *comparatively* less durable.6) Fingerprint scanner being under the screen isn't as quick as a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back.Recommendation: If you're looking for a phone which delivers high performance and smooth interface for your daily use, go for it.But if your prime purpose is gaming, there are better options available.Also, if you're expecting flagship camera performance, you might want to consider other phones. (Pixel 4a is about to release, that's far better probably)Update: Pixel 4a camera is surely much better that Nord's camera.\n\nRead more""]",['\nA good daily driver.\n'],['4.1 out of 5 stars'],"['\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n']"
